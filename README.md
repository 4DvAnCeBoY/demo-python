### Run a Sample Test

1. Navigate to the root project directory and use `pip` to install the latest Selenium library for use in the script:
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. Run the Test Script
   > In order to run the test on [www.saucelabs.com](www.saucelabs.com), change the values of the **`SAUCE_USERNAME`** and **`SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`** variables in the test script to your Sauce Username and Sauce Access Key values.
   > To retrieve this information, login to your saucelabs.com account and navigate to **User Settings**;
  
   * Run the following command to test your python script:
        ```
        $ python on-boarding-modules/python-examples/test_module1.py
        ```
        
   * You may also use 'Run Configurations' in your IDE. For directions on how to setup Run/Debug Configurations refer to your IDE Documentation:
        * [PyCharm Documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html)
        * [Visual Studio Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
